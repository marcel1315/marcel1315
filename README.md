## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My former boss at my first developer job said:

A developer is a problem-solver who solves a problem mainly with code. Here, problem-solving comes before coding.  
Less code usually means less complexity. No code is even better. Then what does a developer do? Go and solve other problems. There are plenty of them.

I like those words.

I try to think why and how the problem is solved inside.  
I think knowing the inside gives me insights or patterns that can help to solve other problems.
