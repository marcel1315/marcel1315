My former boss said:

A developer is a problem-solver who solves a problem mainly with code. Here, problem-solving comes before coding.  
Less code usually means less complexity. No code is even better. Then what does a developer do? Go and solve other problems. There are plenty of them.

I like those words.

I try to think why and how the problem is solved, which gives me insights or patterns that can solve other problems.
